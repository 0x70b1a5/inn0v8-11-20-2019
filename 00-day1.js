// Welcome to PROGRAMMING. Your tender young minds are about to be CHANGED FOREVER 
//   by CONCEPTS the likes of which some of you have never seen. We will start with
//   the smallest pieces of a program, and build up to the largest. You will create
//   several games along the way.

//// 0. Values
// The simplest piece of a program is a value. Values can have one of several "types".

// 0.0. Numbers
// Numbers work just like you think.
1
// Type this into your console and see what happens.
// You can also do math.
1 + 1
2 * 2
3 - 3
4 / 4
// 0.1. Strings
// Strings are groups of zero or more characters.
'hi there'
"you can also use double quotes"
''
" "
// You can also add strings together, but you can't subtract, multiply, or divide.
'Lo,' + ' ' + 'world!'
// We will learn more values later.
//// 1. Variables
// A variable is like a bucket that you can keep a value in. 
// Each variable name must be unique.
// Each variable name must start with an alphabetical letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign.
// To put a value in your variable, do this:
var myVariableName = 1;
// var -> tells the program you are 'declaring' a variable.
// myVariableName -> can be anything.
// ; -> ends the line. This is not required, but it is important. Please use it
// TODO i think alex is doing the rest of this
