On 20 November 2019, we gave a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G3ZPOtCJCUtviQLXGuoSYPIO3LPDh7fyg1CpABSeyUg) on the javascript programming language.

We used [jsbin.com](jsbin.com) to write small games in javascript.

Here are our copies of the games we wrote in jsbin:

* [guess the number](https://jsbin.com/dugirenuci/edit?js,console)
* [goblinbucks](https://jsbin.com/pejapufudi/edit?js,output)
* [hangman](https://jsbin.com/pazuhegeso/12/edit?js,output)

The code is also available in [this github](https://github.com/0x70b1a5/inn0v8-11-20-2019) repository.
Just copy the contents of [index.html](https://github.com/0x70b1a5/inn0v8-11-20-2019/blob/master/index.html) into your jsbin's html tab,
and copy the contents of [01-guessTheNumber.js](https://github.com/0x70b1a5/inn0v8-11-20-2019/blob/master/01-guessTheNumber.js), [02-goblinbucks.js](https://github.com/0x70b1a5/inn0v8-11-20-2019/blob/master/02-goblinbucks.js), or [03-hangman.js](https://github.com/0x70b1a5/inn0v8-11-20-2019/blob/master/03-hangman.js) into your jsbin's javascript tab.
